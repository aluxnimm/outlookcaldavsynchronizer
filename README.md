### User Documentation ###

After installing the plugin, a new ribbon called 'Caldav Synchronizer' is added in Outlook with 3 menu items. 
- Synchronize now
- Options
- About

Use the Options dialog to configure different synchronization profiles. Each profile is responsible for synchronizing one Outlook calendar or task folder with a remote folder of a CalDAV server.

- Add adds a new empty profile
- Delete deletes the current profile
- Copy copies the current profile to a new one

The following properties need to be set for a new profile:

- *Profile name*: An arbitrary name for the profile, which will be displayed at the associated tab.
- *Server settings*:
	- **CalDAV Url:** URL of the remote CalDAV or CardDAV server. You should use a HTTPS connection here for security reason! The Url must end with a **/** e.g. **https://myserver.com/** 
	- If you only have a self signed certificate, add the self signed cert to the Local Computer Trusted Root Certification Authorities. You can import the cert by running the MMC as Administrator. If that fails, see section *'Debugging and more config options'*
	- **Username:** Username to connect to the CalDAV server
	- **Password:** Password used for the connection. The password will be saved encrypted in the option config file.
	- **Email address:** email address used as remote identity for the CalDAV server, necessary to synchronize the organizer
	
- *Outlook settings*:
	- **Outlook Folder:** Outlook folder that should be used for synchronization
- *Sync settings*:
	- Synchronization settings
		- **Outlook -> CalDav (Replicate):** syncronizes everything from outlook to caldav server (one way)
		- **Outlook <- CalDav (Replicate):** synchronizes everything from caldav server to outlook (one way)
		- **Outlook -> CalDav (Merge):** synchronizes everything from outlook to caldav server but don't change events created in caldav server
		- **Outlook <- CalDav (Merge):** synchronizes everything from caldav server to outlook but don't change events created in outlook
		- **Outlook <-> CalDav:** 2-way synchronization between Outlook and CalDav server with one of the following conflict resolution
	- Conflict resolution (only used in 2-way synchronization mode)
		- **Outlook Wins:** If an event is modified in Outlook and in CalDav server since last snyc, use the Outlook version. If an event is modified in Outlook and deleted in CalDav server since last snyc, also use the Outlook version. If an event is deleted in Outlook and modified in CalDav server, also delete it in CalDav server.
		- **Server Wins:** If an event is modified in Outlook and in CalDav server since last snyc, use the CalDav server version. If an event is modified in Outlook and deleted in CalDav server since last snyc, also delete it in Outlook. If an event is deleted in Outlook and modified in CalDav server, recreate it in Outlook.
		- **Automatic:** If event is modified in Outlook and in CalDav server since last snyc, use the last recent modified version. If an event is modified in Outlook and deleted in CalDav server since last snyc, delete it also in Outlook. If an event is deleted in Outlook and modified in CalDav server, also delete it in CalDav server
	- **Synchronization interval (minutes):** Choose the interval for synchronization in minutes, if 'Manual only' is choosen, there is no automatic sync but you can use the 'Synchronize now' menu item.
	- **Synchronization timespan past (days)** and
	- **Synchronization timespan future (days):** For performance reasons it is useful to sync only a given timespan of a big calendar, especially past events are normally not necessary to sync after a given timespan
	- **Deactivate profile:** If activated, current profile is not synced anymore without the need to delete the profile
	
#### Google Calender settings ####

For Google Calender use the following settings:
CalDAV Url: `https://apidata.googleusercontent.com/caldav/v2/<your_google_calendar_id>/events/`.
Check the Use Google OAuth Checkbox instead of entering your password. When testing the settings, you will be redirected to your browser to enter your Google Account password and grant access rights to your Google Calender for OutlookCalDavSynchronizer via the safe OAuth protocol.
For Autodiscovery of all available google calendars use the Url `https://apidata.googleusercontent.com/caldav/v2/` and press the 'Test settings' button.

#### Synology NAS settings ####

For Synology NAS with SSL support use port 5006 and the following settings in your NAS:
In Synology DSM Navigate to control panel > Terminal & SNMP
Select Enable SSH 
Then enter Advanced Settings and set it to High
Now it will work on port 5006 with https.

### Autodiscovery ###

You can use the exact calendar URL or the principal url and use the 'Test settings' button in the option dialog to try to autodiscover available calendars on the server. You can  then choose one of the found calendars in the new window.
If your server has redirections for well-known Urls (./well-known/caldav/) you need to enter the server name only (without path).

### Trouble Shooting ###

Options and state information is stored in the following folder:

    C:\Users\<Your Username>\AppData\Local\CalDavSychronizer

There is one `options_<your outlook profile>.xml` file which stores the options for each outlook profile.
For each sync profile there is a subfolder with state information stored in a relations.xml file after the inital sync. If you delete that folder, a fresh inital sync is performed.

Each synchronization attempt is logged in the `log.txt` file. There you can find information about sync duration and the amount of added, deleted or modified events. Errors and Exceptions are logged aswell. For debugging information of caldav requests there is furthermore a logfile `log_calDavAccess.txt`

 
### Debugging and more config options ###

In the install dir (The default is `'C:\Program Files (x86)\Gerhard Zehetbauer\CalDavSynchronizer'`) you will find the app config file

    CalDavSynchronizer.dll.config

In that xml file you can config timeout parameters and config options in the section `appSettings`
After changing parameters you have to restart Outlook.

- **loadOperationThresholdForProgressDisplay**: amount of sync operations to show the progress bar (default 50)
- **calDavConnectTimeout**: timeout for caldav connects (default 90 sec)
- **calDavReadWriteTimeout**; timeout for caldav read/write requests (default 5 sec)
- **enableTaskSynchronization** Support for task sync (alpha) true or false

If you have problems with SSL/TLS and self-signed certificates, you can change the following settings at your own risk.
The recommended way would be to add the self signed cert to the Local Computer Trusted Root Certification Authorities
You can import the cert by running the MMC as Administrator.

- **disableCertificateValidation** set to true to disable SSL/TLS certificate validation, major security risk, use with caution!
- **enableSsl3** set to true to enable deprecated SSLv3, major security risk, use with caution! 
- **enableTls12** set to false to disable TLS12, not recommended 

In the section `log4net` you can define the log level for the main log and for the caldav data access, 
    level value can be DEBUG or INFO
