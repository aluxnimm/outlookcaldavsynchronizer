History

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2009-10-08: Version 0.4
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  1. Unit tests have been upgraded to NUnit 2.5.2.
     
  2. Per the Microsoft guidelines for class library development, all string
     properties are expected to return String.Empty instead of null (in
     cases where the property is blank).  This is already the case in
     this library but the implementation was problematic.  Instead each
     string getter now takes the following form:
     
         return this.property ?? string.Empty;
         
     Previously the code attempted to translate null to string.Empty whenever
     the value was assigned -- in the constructor, in the setter, etc.  This
     is prone to error.  The form shown above is used instead.
     
  3. Renames.  The following types were renamed to comply with standard
     naming conventions.  Any code will need to be fixed.  Fixes should be
     minor only.
      
     Per class library design guidelines, flag enumerations should be
     named with a plural name.  See FxCop rule FlagsEnumsShouldHavePluralNames.
     These changes are simple to fix in code; simple add an "s" whereever you
     reference the enumeration.
      
      - vCardDeliveryAddressType  =>  vCardDeliveryAddressTypes 
      - vCardPhoneType            =>  vCardPhoneTypes
      - vCardWebSiteType          =>  vCardWebSiteTypes
      
     Per class library design guidelines, the term "WebSite" is actually
     a discrete term "website".  Refer to rule CompoundWordsShouldBeCasedCorrectly 
     in FxCop.  The following types have been renamed:
      
      - vCardWebSite           =>  vCardWebsite
      - vCardWebSiteCollection => vCardWebsiteCollection
      - vCardWebSiteType       =>  vCardWebsiteType    
     
   3. Non-Breaking Changes:
   
     The following changes are internal fixes that are not expected to
     cause compilation issues.
   
     - Assembly marked as language neutral (set to U.S. English).
     - vCardStandardWriter no longer unnecessarily initializes embedInternetImages
     - vCardStandardWriterOptions is now a flags enumeration
     - vCardSubpropertyCollection uses StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase.
     - vCardStandardReader recognizes the date format exported by Outlook 2007.
     - Updated various XML comments.
     
     Some collections have overloads that return the index of a named
     value, e.g. vCardSubpropertyCollection.IndexOf(name).  Internally
     these functions perform a comparison using StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase.
     This should have no impact unless you were using the library under
     a very unique language/environment.     
  

       

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2007-08-xx: Version 0.3
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
     Thank you to many people who have written with kind comments and
     suggestions for the library.  The biggest change in this version
     is a complete refactoring of the code for reading and writing
     the file formats.  The main vCard object model is now a generic
     model.  Format-specific code has been moved to separate classes
     for easier maintenance and support for vCard-compatible formats.
     
     Some changes will probably break your code.  For example, the
     library now supports multiple notes (previously only one note
     per vCard was supported).  The majority of changes will be
     easy to fix, usually just by using the Intellisense(tm) in your
     Visual Studio IDE.  Please refer to the Unit Testing solution
     if you need examples of using the API in various ways.  The
     number of unit tests have been expanded substantially.
     
     - Added support for quoted-printable and standard MIME escape
       encoding.  The read/write process has been completely refactored
       into a separate API to better support multiple vCard formats.
       
     - Added vCardReader and vCardWriter, both abstract classes.  They
       define the core interfaces for creating format-specific readers
       and writers.
       
     - Added vCardStandardReader and vCardStandardWriter.  These two
       classes implement the vCard 2.1 and 3.0 text format specifications.
       These classes are fairly complex due to the wide variety of
       interpretations found in the wild!

     - Removed all format and encoding-specific code from the main
       vCard object model.  Anything format-specific is expected to
       be implemented in a reader or writer class.  Currently only
       the 2.1 and 3.0 formats are implemented, although future
       versions will support RFD, hCard and other variations. 
       Therefore it makes no sense to have anything format-specific
       in the main object model.
              
     - Added support for multiple web sites.  The vCard.Url property
       was removed in favor of vCard.WebSites, a collection.  See
       new items: vCardWebSite, vCardWebSiteCollection, and
       vCardWebSiteType.  Import and export logic also updated.

     - Added support for multiple notes/comments.  The vCard.Note
       property was removed in favor of vCard.Notes, a collection.
       
     - Added support for delivery addresses and delivery labels.
       The current level of support is sufficient for Microsoft Outlook
       but needs some more work for total vCard compliance.

     - Added vCard.AccessClassification.  This indicates the 
       intended access/permissions of the vCard, such as private,
       public or confidential.  It corresponds to the CLASS
       property of the vCard specification.
       
     - Added vCard.Categories (a string collection).  This contains
       any user-defined categories or keywords.  It corresponds
       with the CATEGORIES property of the vCard specification.
       
     - Added vCard.DisplayName.  This maps to the NAME property and
       specifies the display name of the vCard.  A vCard application
       might show this name as a title or header.
                     
     - Added vCard.Latitude and vCard.Longitude.  These correspond with
       the GEO property of the specification.  Usage seems to be
       very rare but is implemented here for completeness.
       
     - Added vCard.Photos, a collection of vCardPhoto objects.
       A photo can be referenced as a URL or specified directly
       with a bitmap or byte array.
       
     - Added vCard.RevisionDate (nullable date).  This contains the
       last revision date of the vCard.  The library does not 
       update this value when you make changes; you need to set
       the revision date yourself.  This maps to the REV property
       of the specification.

     - Renamed vCardPhone.Subtype to vCardPhone.PhoneType in order to
       be consistent with the naming conventions used elsewhere in
       the library.
       
    And much more.

  2007-05-14: Version 0.2
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    vCard Format/Specification Changes:
  
      - Added support for the KEY property, which is used to embed
        a certificate in the vCard.  Only the BASE64 encoding, used by
        Microsoft Outlook and many PIMs, is supported.  Thanks for 
        Martin Meraner
          
      - Added support for the MAILER property.  This property identifies
        the software that generated the vCard; it is described in
        section 2.4.3 of the vCard 2.1 specification.
        
      - Added support for the SOURCE vCard property.  This property
        identifies the URI of a directory that provided information
        for the vCard contents (e.g., an LDAP URL).

      - Added support for the UID property.  This property is a string
        that uniquely identifies the vCard in relation to other vCards.
        There is no standard but typical ID strings might be URLs,
        GUIDs, etc.
        
      - Added support for the X-WAB-GENDER extended property.  This
        property identifies the gender of the contact; it may not be
        supported elsewhere and therefore should be used with care.
        It is an extended property used by Microsoft Outlook.
        
      - Added support for the ROLE property.  This property describes
        the role of the person at his/her organization, e.g. Programmer
        or Executive, etc.
      
    Class Library API Changes:
    
      - Added the standard .NET constructors to the vCardException class.      
      - Added a unit testing project (designed for NUnit).
      - Added vCardCertificate
      - Added vCardCertificateCollection
      - Added vCardDeliveryLabel
      - Added vCardDeliveryLabelType
      - Added vCardGender
      - Added vCardSource
      - Added vCardSourceCollection
      - Added vCardValueType
      - Fixed and expanded inline and XML comments.
      - Fixed typo of vCardPhone.IsCelluar to vCardPhone.IsCellular.
